# CoreML-Stylize
* Implementation of [Google's stylize_v1 Tensorflow model](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/stylize_v1.zip
* Used [tf-coreml's example](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/stylize_v1.zip) to convert the model to ```.mlmodel```.
* Used [Turi Create's example](https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/master/userguide/style_transfer/export-coreml.md) to understand how MLMultiArray works.

### Current issues
* Working on simulator, but not on the device
